# investigate-a-dataset-for-movies

After completing the project, I could do the following:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a usable format
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

### Introduction
For the final project, I conducted my own data analysis and created a file to share that documented my findings. I started by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I used Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers. For this project I didn't use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but I made it clear in my communications that my findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we Udacity folks were not looking for one right answer.

I was given multiple [options](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf) for a Dataset to select from, I selected the dataset  named [TMDb Movie data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv) and performed my analysis.

It was really nice to work on this project and communicate my findings using Python Programming and the data science libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib!
Thanks Udacity for your wonderful Data Analyst NanoDegree program
